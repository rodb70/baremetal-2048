# 2048
This project is originally from :

CS2110 Class Project: 2048 Game

## Introduction
This project is a port of 2048 to the Game Boy Advance. The code was written to satisfy the requirements
of the Georgia Tech cource CS2110 of Spring 2017. I have recently updated the code to remove bugs and
add a score counting feature.

## Usage
Use `make` to compile the software. I use the mednafen emulator to play the game.
